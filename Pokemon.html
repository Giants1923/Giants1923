    <p>
     I want to be the very best,<br>
Like no one ever was.
To catch them is my real test,<br>
To train them is my cause!
(I will travel across the land,<br>
Searching far and wide.
Each Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside!)<br>
Pokemon!
Gotta catch em' all!
It's you and me,
I know it's my destiny!
Pokemon!
Oh, you're my best friend,
In a world we must defend!<br>
Pokemon!
Gotta catch em' all!
(A heart so true,
Our courage will pull us through!)<br>
You teach me and I'll teach you,
Po-ke-mon!
Gotta catch em' all!
Gotta catch em' all!
 Po-ke-mon!!!
